# Methods In Machine Learning
This repository will serve as a collection of different methods in machine learning. It is meant to serve simultaneously as a showcase for prospective employers, a place for new students to learn more, and an archive for me to refresh my knowledge on various topics. It will cover machine learning topics from Linear Regressions through Deep Learning as I complete the projects.

## Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting
This notebook covers the application of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to predict housing prices. It touches on methods such as, preprocessing data, imputation, encoding, and feature selection, piping, and model validation. The notebook culminates in the submission of a .csv file to the Kaggle housing prices competition. The project draws from concepts explored in books such as Introduction to Statistical Learning, R for Data Science, and the Kaggle Learning courses provided on their website.
